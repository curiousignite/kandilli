A quick script to get notified whenever there is a earthquake near TÃ¼rkiye.

## Quickstart

For default script is set to only notify for earthquakes greater than 4.5 ML
But you can change this behaviour however you like.
Edit the code below:

```python
THRESHOLD: float = 4.5 # Change the number here
```
